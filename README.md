## [To Do List](http://isnotafunction.github.io/to-do-list)   

A simple Progressive Web App using localStorage

User stories - as a user I want to be able to:

*  add an item to the to do list
*  click on a button to complete item
*  see both completed items and to do items
*  click on a button to delete an item from to do list
*  click on a button to delete an item from completed list
*  reload the page and see current to do items and completed items
